Hi, welcome to the team. I'm so glad you are here at Indeed.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide for me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week, how I like to work, my north star principles, and some of my, uh, nuance. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

My Job[s]
=========

My title is Group Manager.  I didn't know what that meant when I joined Indeed.  It turns out that the answer is: keep operating as though I'm still CEO of Interviewed.  That means I invest 60% of my time working with Engineering, Content, and Product. The other 40% is hiring, Marketing, CS, and Sales.

It's becoming increasingly rare that I directly build a product sketch, write code, or build an assessment. It feels weird being responsible for everything that happens on Assessments, whether good or bad, without directly touching the underlying work.

Here are my responsibilities:

- Create a high level vision of the products we should build with Product team
- Focus the Content team on building assessments that reach the most job seekers, have measurable impact, and ship quickly
- Ensure the Engineering team is set up for speed and quality
- Represent Indeed Assessments to the rest of the organization
- Manage cross project priorities and ensure we have the right skills on each
- Attract, retain and grow high-performing individuals and teams

Our Average Week
================

If you're one of my direct reports, we'll have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes no matter what.
- 1:1s are for you
- 1:1s are not for status updates
- I'd rather discuss topics of substance and get status updates via email

I keep a running notes file for every person I have 1:1s with.  When I think of something I want to talk about in our next 1:1, I leave myself a note.  During our 1:1, I'll cross things off and add comments.

We'll have a staff meeting with your peers every week for 60 minutes no matter what.  We use Loupe to enter the updates ahead of time. Similar to 1:1s, my goal is to move away from doing status updates at this meeting in favor of discussing issues of substance that affect the whole team.

Communication
=============

Slack
-----

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I like responding quickly.  Slack is my default, except for todos. I send task requests via email so they don't get lost in chatter.

Email
-----

I use reminders in my inbox as to-do list and maintain inbox zero (with the help of Google Inbox's boomerang feature).

I will respond to emails within 24 hours and usually the same day.

I'm conscious of switching to email when I want the discussion to be more thoughtful, slower, with longer responses than slack.

SMS
---

I almost never SMS in a work context.

Hangouts/Phone/In-person
------------------------

For discussions that are emotionally nuanced or require lots of typing, I prefer to shift discussion from Slack to a high-bandwidth channel like a call or in person.

Meeting Protocol
----------------

I go to a lot of meetings.  I aggressively prune the attendee list and frequency of meetings.  I keep 99% of my calendar events public and default to allow-modify by guests; that means you can move the meeting without asking me.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it's scheduled to end, let's give the time back to everyone. If it's clear the intended goal won't be achieved in the allotted time, let's stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

Work hours
==========

I typically wake up around 6-7 and do a couple hours of work sitting in the tub with my laptop before coming into the office around 9-10.  I usually leave the office around 6-7 and then do a couple more hours of work at home.

I work on weekends; it's my time to get long, uninterrupted stretches when I can focus on the bigger picture and work on creative projects (like this readme).  This is my choice, I don't expect you to work on weekends. I might Slack you things but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until Monday morning.

Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let's talk.

Heard a rumour? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I'd love to hear as soon as possible. Come by my desk, stop me in the hall, shoot me a Slack message, we don't need to wait for our next scheduled 1:1. Feel free to put something in my calendar, don't feel like you need to ask first; just put a summary agenda in the calendar invite so I can triage appropriately.  Is my calendar full? Send me a message and I'll very likely be able to move something around.

North Star Principles
=====================

Heavily bias towards action
---------------------------

Meetings where we debate potential directions are valuable, but I expect the discussion to result in a decision by the end of the meeting.  I believe that starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to discuss.

80/20
-----

I am always looking for the parts of a thing that are in the bad side of the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).  This often results in my wanting to simplify features or our approach.

Prioritize systematically
-------------------------

I think of this as a 3-dimensional matrix, where the axis are:

- Number of people affected
- Strength of effect
- Difficulty (omitted from chart for simplicity)

Avoid working on things that weakly affect a small number of people.  See 80/20.

Teams should operate like pro sports teams
------------------------------------------

I'm not a sports fan, but the analogy fits.  My thinking on teams most closely aligns with Netflix's philosophy (<https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr>).

We are high-performing professionals who have come together to achieve a shared team goal: to help people get jobs; and to achieve personal professional goals: career success and fulfillment.  Because we are high-performing professionals; there are many teams we could be on at Indeed or at other companies. Our team must continually re-earn its spot as the best team to be on or else our teammates will leave for other teams.  When someone is not delivering what the team needs, we coach them. If coaching doesn't work, we ask them to leave the team.

Disagree and commit
-------------------

Amazon says it more succinctly than I can...

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

<http://www.amazonianblog.com/2016/11/what-it-means-to-disagree-and-commit-and-how-i-do-it.html>

Shamelessly imitate
-------------------

I will frequently ask:

-   What do other teams at Indeed do to solve this?
-   What do our competitors do?
-   Who has done something similar before?

Knowing the answers is table stakes before we begin discussing our approach.

Feedback
========

I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.    

When/how?
---------

I don't believe in storing feedback and then scheduling a time to provide it. If I have feedback to give you I'll work to provide it as soon as possible, in the moment if I can unless I'm feeling emotionally charged and need time to reflect. It's unlikely it'll start with "I have some feedback to give you", instead it'll probably start with, "I observed that..."

We will have quarterly reviews, but those should mostly be a rollup of feedback you've already heard during the quarter.

I will ask you for feedback often.  I will keep asking even if you say you don't have any feedback.  I appreciate those who take the time to give me thoughtful feedback because it shows that they care about helping me improve.

Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:

### Safety
Unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback. Should be high.

### Effort
The amount of work in order to give feedback. Should be low.

### Benefit
How likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? Should be high.

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

How can I help you
==================

Provide context
---------------

Most of my day is spent collecting and sharing context/information across teams on Assessments and products at Indeed, and helping setting priorities. I'll try to push information to you as much as I can but feel free to ask about anything else.

Provide an outside(ish) perspective
-----------------------------------

I won't be working on your project day to day but will be close enough to have informed thoughts.

Cheer
-----

I aspire to be someone who celebrates your successes.  I'm not good at it yet, but I'm working on it.

Firefight
---------

Don't hesitate to say: "I could use a hand with..." or "I screwed up: ..."

How you can help me
===================

Do amazing work
---------------

This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.

Disagree with me
----------------

The best solutions comes from a healthy debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos. I'll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you'll challenge mine.

Tell me when I screw up
-----------------------

This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don't notice. I need to know or I'll likely do it again.

Communicate
-----------

One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I'll fill you in or go find out.

Bring your friends
------------------

We're growing the team and you know who you want to work with.

Nuance
======

I am an introvert and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me.

Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and more than eight you will find that I am secretly thinking the whole time that the meeting should be smaller.

When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.
